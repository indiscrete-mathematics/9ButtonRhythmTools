# Frequently Asked Questions (or not)
#### Why is this character associated with this sample song?
I lifted the note map of P'nM 10's "Goonies R Good Enough", so it would seem reasonable to draw the characters of that game too... but I've never seen Goonies so I didn't feel eligible to incorporate Mikey in this simulator. But I am an occasional fan of 80s music, so I instead chose a character who coincidentally looked like Cyndi Lauper.

#### What improvement does this game have over Lunatic Rave 2? What is the difference?
For the most part - I wouldn't know, I've never played LR2 (but it looks amazingly polished and the community seems helpful; I'm inclined to say there is no improvement.) What I do know is; this project is implemented in the Unity editor.

#### Is this game really open source?
Since the engine upon which this game is based is in fact not open source; no it is not. It is, I would call it, open script.

#### Full game when?
When I'm less busy + if I don't have a more original idea to work on.
