# Unity Engine 9-Button Rhythm Game Tools
Scripts used for a 9-button rhythm game which simulates Konami arcade series Pop'n Music.

Notes fall from the top of the screen and will be scored if they are hit at the right time, when they touch the horizontal line at the bottom of the screen.

# Gameplay
9 buttons:
>A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L

```insert``` to autoplay.
I recommend you hold four fingers on each side of the keyboard; and press the middle button G when prompted to, by moving your index finger

# Scoring System
Currently the player's score is based on completion and has no stand-in for Pop'n Music's Groove Gauge.

# Editor Scenes
A recommended order of scenes is:

- 1 title screen
- 1 character selection screen
- 1 scene per song
- 1 closing scene (if desired)

# Editor-Installation
For now, this is not a package. There are only scripts.

# Frequently Asked Questions (or not)
#### In Burstin' Tunes, why is this character associated with this sample song?
I lifted the note map of P'nM 10's "Goonies R Good Enough", so it would seem reasonable to draw the characters of that game too... but I've never seen Goonies (sorry, I only learned about the film from P'nM when I was selecting an instrumental song to recreate) so I didn't feel eligible to incorporate Mikey in this simulator. But I am an occasional fan of 80s music, so I instead chose a character who coincidentally looked like Cyndi Lauper.

#### What improvement does this implementation have over Lunatic Rave 2? What is the difference?
For the most part - I wouldn't know, I've never played or edited songs in LR2 (but it looks amazingly polished and the community seems helpful; I'm inclined to say there is no improvement.) What I do know is; this project is implemented in the Unity editor.

#### Is the demo game really open source?
Since the engine upon which this game is based is in fact not open source; no it is not. It is, I would call it, open script.

#### Full game when?
When I'm less busy + if I don't have a more original idea to work on.

#### Where can we play Pop'n Music?
If you do not have access to an arcade cabinet I would recommend buying a PlayStation console release and maybe a Pop'n Music controller. Even if you do not have a PlayStation you can legally emulate the game by building a ROM/disc image from your purchased game.

I also highly recommend checking out the game Rhythmic Pop'n, another Pop'n Music simulator developed by Aqua Bunny Productions. It is free to download, link is provided below too.
